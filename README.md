# IDEN (Identification Eden) - Authentication App Using Blockchain Technology (Ethereum - Solidity)
IDEN is an identification system that makes use of Blockchain technology. It was developed on the Ethereum Blockchain and takes advantage of any features implied with it. It has three roles, the "Issuer", the "Citizen" and the "Verifier", and benefits from smart contracts to carry out its functions. The issuer is responsible for entering the identity details of the citizen and the verifier on the Blockchain. The data is entered through a form in the application environment of the issuer and then stored in the wallet corresponding to the address provided by the citizen or verifier. Then, the citizen from the respective environment, can check his data and respond to incoming requests to share his data. Finally, the verifier has the ability, through his own environment, to request the data of a citizen, confirm their ownership and perform the desired actions. In terms of security, it inherits all the features of smart contracts, so all data is encrypted, with constant checks to avoid possible errors.

Below are some screenshots of the application's user interface:
